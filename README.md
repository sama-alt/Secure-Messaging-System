# Secure-Messaging-System
By this project , two or more users can message each other . Before starting messaging they must log in or if new user then register through their email id and then a OTP is sent to the email id and by using the OTP user can access in the system . I worked as a active team member .  We implemented the project by Java and SQLLITE.
